# pitch-it

> This project features a Flask application using a PostgreSQL database and deployed to Heroku.

## Description

`pitch-it` is a webapp that allows users to use one minute of their lives to impress someone by actually saying something meaningful. Users can submit their one minute pitches and other users can vote on them and leave comments to give their feedback on them. 

`pitch-it` is live at https://pitched-it.herokuapp.com/.
